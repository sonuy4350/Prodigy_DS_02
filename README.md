## Task 02: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Objective
The objective of this task is to perform **data cleaning** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on a dataset of choice in order to explore relationships between variables and identify meaningful patterns and trends.

---

## 📊 Dataset
- Dataset Name: Titanic Dataset  
- File Used: `titanic.csv`  
- Description: Contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including survival status, age, gender, passenger class, fare, and embarkation port.

---

## 🛠️ Data Cleaning Steps
- Handled missing values in the `Age` column using median imputation  
- Filled missing values in the `Embarked` column using the most frequent value  
- Removed the `Cabin` column due to a large number of missing values  
- Dropped unnecessary columns such as `PassengerId`, `Name`, and `Ticket`

---

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The following analyses and visualizations were performed:

- Survival count distribution  
- Survival comparison by gender  
- Survival comparison by passenger class  
- Age distribution of passengers  
- Fare distribution  
- Correlation heatmap using numeric features  

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate compared to males  
- Passengers in first class had better survival chances than those in second and third class  
- Younger passengers showed a slightly higher survival probability  
- Passengers who paid higher fares were more likely to survive

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Google Colab  

---

## 📂 Repository Contents
- `Prodigy_DS_02.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing data cleaning and EDA  
- `titanic.csv` – Dataset used for analysis  
- `README.md` – Project documentation  

---

## ✅ Conclusion
This task provided hands-on experience in cleaning real-world data and performing exploratory data analysis.  
The visualizations and insights helped in understanding the relationships between different variables in the dataset.
